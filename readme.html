	A nodejs implementation of the Classical game of 
	<a target='_blank' href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chowka_bhara'>Chowka bhara</a> 
	with :
	<br/><br/>

	A. Attacking rules
	<br/>
	B. Pairing rules (Gatti)
	<br/>
	C. Safe house (Gatta)
	<br/>
	D. Multi-Player options
	<br/>
	<hr/>
	<ul>
		<li>Each player gets 4 pawns. Goal of the game is to take all 4 pawns to the center of the grid via defined pathway, specific to the player.</li>
		<li>Every time, player rolls his dice to get one of these values - 1,2,3,4,8. If a player gets 4 or 8, he gets to roll the dice again.</li>
		<li>Each player has to kill at least one pawn of his opponent to enter the inner circle. 
		For each kill, a player gets a free roll of dice.</li>
		<li>Safe houses : Boxes marked with X are safe houses. Here, opponents cannot kill the pawn. (It will be usually other player's home box)</li>
		<li>Gatti : 
			<ul>
				<li>If 2 pawns of same player are put in the same box (other than safe house) - it is called gatti. This can be done only in the inner circle.</li>
				<li>Once gatti is formed, a player cannot separate the pawns.</li>
				<li>They have to be moved together (only in multiples of 2). If a player gets 2, then he can move gatti one box ahead only.</li>
				<li>A gatti can kill a single pawn but a single pawn cannot kill a gatti. A gatti can be killed by another gatti only.</li>
				<li>2 gatti's of same player cannot be in the same box.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>If the values are beyond game play - then the turn has to be forfeited. Currently this is done by the moderator who is appointed before the game starts.</li>
		<li>If a player has multiple dice values, he can move any pawn for any value - need not guarantee the order.</li>
	</ul>
